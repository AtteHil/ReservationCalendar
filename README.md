# ReservationCalendar
Calendar to make cat hotel reservations

During development front is hosted on Vercel and is accessable in: https://reservation-calendar-psi.vercel.app/

Backend is hosted on Render 
(server takes about 50 secs to boot after inactivity)

as I update the GitHub repository new deployments are automatically ran to both hosting services.

Site is work in progress.

future updates (to keep track what I am going to implement on the site)

- login front [x]
- server login + jwt
- mongo atlas as database  [x]
- improvements to visualize site (material ui loading components and alerts for user)
- making reservations 
- view when the "hotel" is booked (logged in users)
- Admin credentials to delete bookings or set "hotel" closed
- demo video of the site and/or visitor credentials which can not be used to make real reservations but can be used to demo site
- Front Page with images of "happy customers"


what Will not be done
- registration Page (site is only for me and my family for personal usage)
